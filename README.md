# MyDir

A Visual and interactive GUI for analyzing the output of the cmd "dir" command.

The program receives the output of the command as a txt file, and presents the information in a hirarchieal, comfortable structure.

Also, it enables text filtering and filtering by a pre-defined file extention (currently set to .dat).

An example for an input file is available under "test.txt".

(The exact cmd command is dir "path" /S).
